By default every character is important and no new line characters are eaten up.
Therefore the following to lines will be like: "alma \n alma \n "
alma
alma
When we define the {@options nl} then the new line character after the macro closing character is skipped.
This means that here we will have an empty line and after that the next line will be "almaalma" and then "alma"
without an empty line between

almaalma
alma
See... there is no empty line before this line or before the previous line.
