/**
 * When a code is starting and ending a scope it has to pass a marker object to the call to {@link
 * MacroRegister#pop(Marker)} and {@link MacroRegister#push(Marker)}. The {@code Marker} object passed to {@link
 * MacroRegister#pop(Marker)} should be equal to the one that was passed to {@link MacroRegister#push(Marker)}. This
 * helps preventing the macro code to close a scope in a way that it was not supposed to. For example using the macro
 * {@code @end} without a previously matching {@code @begin} in a {@code #block} macro or in an included file. See how
 * the macros {@code javax0.jamal.builtins.Begin} and {@code javax0.jamal.builtins.End} use the implementation of this
 * interface provided in the tools module.
