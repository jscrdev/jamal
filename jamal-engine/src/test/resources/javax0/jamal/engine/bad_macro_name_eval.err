When the user defined macro name itself is defined as the result of a macro evaluation it is forbidden to get the
separator character as the result of the evaluation. In this case `z` is evaluated to `a|` and that would make
`|` to the separator character for the arguments (we have here only one). It could be

{@define z=a}
{@define a(k)=hkh}
{{z}|K}

this would be correct
