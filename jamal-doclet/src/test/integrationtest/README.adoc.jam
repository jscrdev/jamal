= Jamal Doclet Integration Test

This project is not published as part of the Jamal project.
The files in this project are to be used manually to test the Jamal Javadoc implementation.

Jamal itself is using Jamal Doclet, but that is not sufficient for the testing.
To avoid circular dependencies the Jamal source uses the last released version of the doclet.
Testing an already published release is pointless.

To use this integration test project first ensure that you have the developed SNAPSHOT version installed.
This is usually done executing

    mvn clean install

in the root project folder.

After that you can

    cd jamal-doclet/src/test/integrationtest

and execute the same

    mvn clean install

command.
When it has finished, you can have a look at the files

    target/apidocs/

To see the JavaDoc you should open the

    target/apidocs/index.html

file and check that the pages are OK.
There is no automation at the moment for the execution of the test and for the assertions for the test result.
