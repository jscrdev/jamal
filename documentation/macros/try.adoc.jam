{%@import macrodoc.jim%}
{%MACRO name="try" since=1.5.0%}

The macro try will evaluate its content and return the result.
The evaluation does not open a new scope, just like in the case of the macro `{@eval }`.
In case the evaluation results an error, then the result will be empty string.

For example, the following macro will produce an empty string.

{%sample/
{@try {macro}}
%}

The macro `macro` is not defined, but the error is caught with the macro `try`.

The macro `try` can also be used to include the error message in the output.
If we use an `!` character right after (no spaces) the `try` keyword the result will be the error message.

{%sample/
{@try! {macro}}{@define macro=hay macro}
{@try! {macro}}
%}

will result in

{%output%}

If there is no error, then the output is the result of the evaluated text inside the macro.

NOTE: Jamal usually allows you to have spaces in places like the keyword `try` and the following `!` or `?`.
For example, you can have spaces between the macro name `define` and the `!`, `?` or `~` character.
In the case of `try` there must be no space.
The reason for this strictness is that `try` is followed by arbitrary text evaluated by the macro itself.
Allowing space between the macro name and the `!` or `?` character would result in ambiguous syntax.
We could not tell if the `!` or `?` character is part of the macro use or already the first starting character of the text to be evaluated.

If we use a `?` character right after (no spaces) the `try` keyword, then the result will be the string `true` if there was no error and `false` is there was an error.
This can be used to test the "computability" of the text.

The macro `try` should only be used to debug certain macro files.
When an error happens, and the `try` macro catches the error the scopes may not be properly closed.

There is also a {%$ catch%} macro that can be used to catch errors.
