{%MACRO name="Special NoName User Defined Macro" since=2.0.0%}

There is a special user defined macro that has no name.
It is automatically created by Jamal every time it is needed.
This user defined macro is used whenever the macro closing string follows the macro opening string directly.
It can be used when you want to insert the macro opening string into the text, but you do not want it to be interpreted as a macro opening.
For example, the following input

{%sample/
{}
%}

will result in the following output:

{%output%}

If you use this macro inside another macro, then the result will be evaluated after the macro itself was evaluated.
For example

{%sample/
{@define z={} this is an opening}
{@try!{!z}}
%}

will result in the following output:

{%output%}

The recommendation is to use this macro only on the top level instead of the longer

{%sample/
{@escape ``{``}
%}

Also, the macro closing string can be used without any escaping on the top level.
