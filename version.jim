-- This file defines the version of the project.
-- This is more effective than defining the project version in a maven property because that cannot be used to reference the parent.

-- the project groupId. It has to start with com. and a registered domain name or else it cannot get into maven central
{@define GROUPID=com.javax0.jamal}

-- module names are jamal.XXX
{@define MODULE_PREFIX=jamal.}
-- package names are less restrictive and it is not likely that anyone else would use javax0 as top level package
{@define PACKAGE_PREFIX=javax0.jamal.}
