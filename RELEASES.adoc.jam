== Jamal Releases

{%@define RELEASE($x)==== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/$x[$x]%}


{%RELEASE/1.9.0%}

Maven extension module is developed.
Using this module there is no need to preprocess `pom.xml.jam` or `pom.jam` files.
Maven automatically reads those files instead of the `pom.xml` using the extension.
Ruby scripts do not share the global variables any more.
It was a bug that the differently named Ruby scripts used the same set of global variables.
Ruby and Groovy macros can be configured using options and not only user defined macros.
PlantUml macro also uses options and not only user defined macros to define the parameters like the image directory.
Built-in macros can have multiple names, and the assertion package immediately starts to use it so `equals` and `equal` ending denote the same macro.
Evaluate can evaluate macros in its input in a loop till all macros get evaluated.
Environment variable can be queried to throw exception when the variable is not defined.

{%RELEASE/1.8.0%}

SnipCheck was introduced to enforce snippet and documentation consistency.
There is a new package to check consistency.
This is the assertions package.
The macro statefulness is checked during macro load an in case a macro is stateful and not annotated to signal this then the macro load fails.
XML snippet reading bug (using CWD instead of document dir) was fixed.
Different dependencies were updated to the latest releases.

{%RELEASE/1.7.9%}

Fully reworked, redesigned, and functionally extended debugger client
`{@undefined }` macros can be `{@define ! ...}` defined

{%RELEASE/1.7.8%}

This release opens the debugger package, and so it can be used from Java::Geci. It still needs investigation why this is needed, though, but this patch solves this issue.

io:delete gives more meaningful error messages

TestWrite did not check that the output was really written. Fixed.

Various documentation and JavaDoc fixes.
SNAKE Yaml now uses the latest version and not an outdated one.
Build runs with Github action
Various tests and some production code were fixed so that the build runs also on Windows and Linux.

{%RELEASE/1.7.7%}

Markdown module was added with one single macro. Using this you can use markdown in JavaDoc files.
Macro can implement its own fetching, and that way now escape macro can also be aliased.
Option nl is removed, does not exist any more. Any \ after a macro escapes the next new line character.
For has new keyword from to iterate through a collection that a user defined ObjectHolder macro can provide.

{%RELEASE/1.7.6%}

Yaml XML macro extended to have attributes and CDATA in the output when you design a Yaml, especially for XML.
Macro `define` can specify optional parameters.
It is an error to use `:=` on a parameterless macro without `()` to avoid ambiguity.
Even I, who created the whole shenanigans, could not remember if `a:=` defines a global or a pure macro.

{%RELEASE/1.7.5%}

yaml can be exported as XML
debugger can handle breakpoints, UI was changed
yaml macros Add and isResolved are added
macro tests can now be written an jyt (Jamal Yaml Test) files


{%RELEASE/1.7.4%}

JavaDoc support
Yaml support
jamal-io module writing file and stdout and stderr
various bugfixes
collect can collect onceAs
verbatim user-defined macros
default macro can get the actual macro name
snippet trim macro can verticalTrimOnly
macro use can define alias for already existing macro


{%RELEASE/1.7.3%}

An interactive debugger was developed for Jamal transformation to follow the transformation step-by-step.
Jamal can be started using jbang.
command-line parameters are refactored and much more user-friendly.


{%RELEASE/1.7.2%}

New module integrating the Ruby scripting language
A bug is fixed that caused reporting the wrong error when there was an error inside an included file.


{%RELEASE/1.7.1%} Groovy module

This release includes a Groovy module that you can use to embed Groovy code into the Jamal input.

Closer objects are invoked in the order they were (first) declared.
bug fixed and makes it possible to use :a user-defined macros when USED and not only when defined
Test support can set the separators after the input is specified.
Cast tool was created in the tool module and use was moved from snippet to there.


{%RELEASE/1.7.0%}

New macro to undefine a user-defined macro.
Built-in macros can do post-processing where they can modify the final result.
jamal-snippet macro xmlFormat uses the new functionality and can format the whole document at the end
Embedding application can use a general 'context' that can also be used by the macros


{%RELEASE/1.6.5%}

Macro and module plantuml was developed


{%RELEASE/1.6.4%}

Snippet collection throws an error when a snippet is not closed but only in case the snippet is used.
Unclosed macro opening character reported line number is correct after a bug fixed that reported the last opened macro line number.
documentation about how to write a built-in macro was started
phantom parameters are handled correctly in case a macro does not have a parameter but there are zero string resulting macros evaluated in the parameters
InputHandler got a new startWith method
ScriptBasic module was reintegrated, following the release and is now part of the release
it is possible to define a user defined macro default which is used in case a macro is not defined. The real good use of it is when the user defined macro is defined using Java support and has special logic.


{%RELEASE/1.6.3%}

A new format for the for loop macro that lets you have values that contain the ) character inside.


{%RELEASE/1.6.2%}

trimLine was not included in the META-INF. It is now fixed.


{%RELEASE/1.6.1%}

File and directory macros were added to the snippet module.

{%RELEASE/1.6.0%}

This release contains two new modules: snippet support and test.
Macro try cleans the macro nesting stack properly, more possibility to recover after `try` catches an error
`import` does not allow dangling `begin` macros new macro `escape` was implemented to support macro opening and closing escaping documentation samples are generated on the file and not just copied from tests


{%RELEASE/1.5.3%}

Option `skipForEmpty` was implemented for `for` macro error message fixed in for


{%RELEASE/1.5.2%}

FEATURE: `for` macro is inner scope dependent.
FIX: multi variable `for` works properly when some of the values are empty strings FEATURE: multi variable `for` accepts less or more than required arguments with option lenient


{%RELEASE/1.5.1%}

```
`
