= Using Kroki service

This is a simple demonstration of how you can include pictures using the Kroki service into an Asciidoc file.

You have to import the resource `kroki.jim` into your Asciidoc file.



The `kroki.jim` file contains macros that can be used to include pictures in an Asciidoc file.

After that you can use the `kroki` macro to include pictures.
