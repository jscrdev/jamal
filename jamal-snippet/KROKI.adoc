= Using Kroki service

This is a simple demonstration of how you can include pictures using the Kroki service into an Asciidoc file.

You have to import the resource `kroki.jim` into your Asciidoc file.



The `kroki.jim` file contains macros that can be used to include pictures into a Asciidoc file.
However, that file also includes macros for Asciidoc.
Both macros are called `kroki`, and have the same parameter.
You should tell which output you would like to use, therefore you should first invoke the macro `use:kroki:asciidoc`.
This will set the output to Asciidoc. 

Guess, what you can see the Markdown version of this file.

After that you can use the `kroki` macro to include pictures.
