This file defines symbolic names for upcoming releases.

During the development of the release 1.12.7 it was not sure if it will be a minor release or a major one.
The documentation many times refers to this release as 1.12.7, but it is not sure if it will be 1.12.7 or 1.13.0 or 2.0.0

To avoid global search and replace here we define symbolic names for the releases in the future.
Past releases, when this practice was not used are left intact.
After all, they are history and history does not change (rip Orwell).

The symbolic names we use are city names.
The first "next" release is named after the city where I lived in most of the my life.

{@define RELEASE:BUDAPEST=2.0.0}
